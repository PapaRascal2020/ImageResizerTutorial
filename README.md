# Image Resizer Tutorial
This is for a tutorial I am doing on a Basic Image Resizing tool in Python3

## Requirements
* Python3
* PILLOW (pip3 install PILLOW)
* Glob

## Info

This program takes images in the input folder and checks to see if the image is more than 4MP. If it is then it will resize it to the dimensions specified and save a new version of the file in the output folder. 

Very Very Basic
